# Client generation
In order for Client generation to work correctly, we expect the following conditions to be met:

- Hubs are named `${name}Hub.ts` (not strictly necessary, but good for consistency)
- Hub files have a default export whose variable name is `${name}Hub`
- This `${name}Hub` variable has a declared type of `HubTemplate<R, S>` where both `R` and `S` are explictly declared as well
  - `R` and `S` do not need to be exported interfaces
  - `R` and `S` should be completely defined internally.
    - TODO: This should be augmented. Code generation is almost useless if it can't pull types.

## Output
- We expect two files to be generated: `${name}Client.ts` and `${name}ClientTypes.ts`
- If `${name}Client.ts` is already generated, we do not override.
  - `${name}Client.ts` should be initially generated with stub functions (that are typed already) that the underlying `${name}Hub.ts` has, at the time of generation.
- `${name}ClientTypes.ts` should be marked as autogenerated, and will be overridden as the underlying `${name}Hub.ts` changes.
